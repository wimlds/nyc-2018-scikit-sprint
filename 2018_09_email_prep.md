Hi Everyone,

We are very excited to host the **2nd Annual WiMLDS/ scikit-learn open source sprint** and have you join us for a day of learning and contributing to a critical Python machine learning library!  We also think it will be day of fun and meeting new people.    

Special thanks for StackExchange for sponsoring their space on a Saturday.

## Pre-event Reminders

- The event is on a Saturday in NYC, which can possibly mean ---> subway delays.  Check out the MTA Weekender to see if your transit line is impacted:  http://web.mta.info/weekender.html
